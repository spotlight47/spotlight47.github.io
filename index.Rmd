Personal Website<br>
Created:  2/17/2018<br> 
This is my personal static website developed in the R Studio environment.<br>
Special thanks to R-Ladies NYC and Emily Zabor for getting me started with building websites in R. Hint: Learn to KnitR. [Tutorial](http://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html#personal_websites)<br>
It's much easier than updating files in FTP and faster than posting updates to WordPress! Plus, I get to stay in the R-Studio enviroment!<br>
